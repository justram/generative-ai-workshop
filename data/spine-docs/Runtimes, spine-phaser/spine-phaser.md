Unless otherwise indicated, the examples and GitHub file links refer to the v4 version. However, everything applies to the v3 version by simply replace `-v4` with `-v3` from paths and links.

The spine-phaser runtime is implemented on top of [spine-ts core](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/4.2/spine-ts/spine-core), a TypeScript implementation of the renderer-agnostic Spine Runtimes core APIs. The spine-phaser runtime supports all platforms supported by Phaser 3 and 4, including rendering via the [Canvas APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) as well as rendering via [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

The spine-phaser runtime supports all Spine features when using the Phaser WebGL renderer. When using the Phaser Canvas renderer, the spine-phaser runtime does not support [meshes](/spine-meshes), [tint black](/spine-slots#Tint-black), or [blend modes](/spine-slots#Blending).


## Installation
To use spine-phaser in your Phaser project, you must first include its sources.

### Vanilla JavaScript
In vanilla JavaScript, use a `script` tag to include the spine-phaser runtime from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@esotericsoftware/spine-phaser-v4@4.2.*/dist/iife/spine-phaser-v4.js"></script>
```

> **Note:** Ensure that the `major.minor` version of spine-phaser matches the `major.minor` Spine Editor version you are exporting from. See [Synchronizing versions](/spine-versioning#Synchronizing-versions) for more information.

Next, add the Spine scene plugin to your Phaser game configuration:

```
const config = {
   ...
   plugins: {
      scene: [
         { key: "spine.SpinePlugin", plugin: spine.SpinePlugin, mapping: "spine" }
      ]
   }
}
new Phaser.Game(config);
```

All scenes in your project can now use the spine-phaser runtime.

Check out [`basic-vanilla-js-example.html`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example/basic-vanilla-js-example.html) for a full example.


The spine-phaser package also provides source maps for debugging, as well as minified versions of spine-phaser, which can be used by replacing the `.js` file suffix with `.min.js` in the unpkg URLs.

For local vendoring, you can build `spine-phaser.js` by following the instructions in the spine-ts [README.md](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/README.md).


### NPM or Yarn
When using NPM or Yarn for dependency management, add spine-phaser the usual way:

```
npm install @esotericsoftware/spine-phaser-v4@~4.2.0
```

> **Note:** Ensure that the `major.minor` version of spine-phaser matches the `major.minor` Spine Editor version you are exporting from. See [Synchronizing versions](/spine-versioning#Synchronizing-versions) for more information.

Next, add the Spine scene plugin to your Phaser game configuration:

```
import Phaser from "phaser"
import {SpinePlugin} from "@esotericsoftware/spine-phaser-v4"

const config = {
   ...
   plugins: {
      scene: [
         { key: "spine.SpinePlugin", plugin: SpinePlugin, mapping: "spine" }
      ]
   }
}
new Phaser.Game(config);
```

All scenes in your project can now use the spine-phaser runtime.

Check out [`the spine-phaser esbuild/TypeScript project`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example/typescript) for minimal example.

Our module packages also contain source maps as well as `d.ts` typings for improved debugging and development.

## Samples
The spine-phaser runtime includes several samples demonstrating its feature set.

To run the examples locally:

1. Install Git and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for your operating system.
2. Clone the spine-runtimes repository: `git clone https://github.com/esotericsoftware/spine-runtimes`
2. At the terminal, navigate to `spine-runtimes/spine-ts`, then run `npm install & npm run dev`.

This builds the spine-phaser runtime, then opens a browser, displaying the example index for all spine-ts based runtimes.

Click on the spine-phaser example you are interested in, and check out the code in the [`spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example) folder.

## Updating the spine-phaser Runtime
Before updating your project's spine-phaser runtime, please consult our [guide on Spine editor and runtime version management](/spine-runtime-architecture#Versioning).

To update the spine-phaser runtime in vanilla JavaScript, change the version string in the `src` attribute or the `script` tag fetching spine-phaser from unpkg.

To update the spine-phaser runtime when managing dependencies with NPM or Yarn, change the version string in your `package.json` file.

> **Note:** If you change the `major.minor` version of the spine-phaser package, you have to re-export your Spine skeletons with the same Spine Editor `major.minor` version! See [Synchronizing versions](/spine-versioning#Synchronizing-versions) for more information.

# Using spine-phaser
The spine-phaser runtime supports all Spine features when using the Phaser WebGL renderer. When using the Phaser Canvas renderer, the spine-phaser runtime does not support [meshes](/spine-meshes), [tint black](/spine-slots#Tint-black), or [blend modes](/spine-slots#Blending).

## Asset Management
### Exporting for spine-phaser

![](/img/spine-runtimes-guide/spine-ue4/export.png)

Follow the instructions in the Spine User Guide on how to:

1. [Export skeleton & animation data](/spine-export)
2. [Export texture atlases containing the images of your skeleton](/spine-texture-packer)

An export of the skeleton data and texture atlas of your skeleton will yield the following files:

![](/img/spine-runtimes-guide/spine-ue4/exported-files.png)

1. `skeleton-name.json` or `skeleton-name.skel`, containing your skeleton and animation data, either in the JSON or binary format.
2. `skeleton-name.atlas`, containing information about the texture atlas.
3. One or more `.png` files, each representing one page of your texture atlas containing the packed images your skeleton uses.

> **Note**: You should prefer binary skeleton exports over JSON exports, as they are smaller in size and faster to load.

When serving these files, make sure the server emits the correct MIME types.

### Updating Spine Assets
During development, you may frequently update your Spine skeleton data and texture atlas files. You can simply overwrite these source files (.json, .skel, .atlas, .png) by re-exporting from the Spine Editor and replacing the existing files in your Phaser project.

Ensure that the `major.minor` version of spine-phaser matches the `major.minor` Spine Editor version you are exporting from. See [Synchronizing versions](/spine-versioning#Synchronizing-versions) for more information.

## Core classes
The spine-phaser API is built on top of the generic TypeScript [spine-core](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core) runtime, which provides platform independent  core classes and algorithms to load, query, modify, and animate Spine skeletons.

Here, we will briefly discuss the most important core classes that you will  encounter in your day-to-day use of spine-phaser. Please consult the [Spine Runtimes Guide](/spine-runtimes-guide)
for a detailed overview of the Spine Runtimes architecture, core classes, and API usage.

The [`TextureAtlas`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/TextureAtlas.ts) class stores the data loaded from an `.atlas` file and its corresponding `.png` image files.

The [`SkeletonData`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/SkeletonData.ts) class stores the data loaded from a `.json` or `.skel` skeleton file.  The skeleton data contains information about the bone hierarchy, slots, attachments, constraints, skins, and animations. A `SkeletonData` instance is usually loaded by also providing an `Atlas` from which it sources the images to be used by the skeleton it represents. It serves as a blueprint for creating `Skeleton` instances. Multiple skeletons can be instantiated from the same atlas and skeleton data, which then share the loaded data, minimizing both load times and memory consumption at runtime.

The [`Skeleton`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/Skeleton.ts) class stores an instance of a skeleton, created from a `SkeletonData` instance. A skeleton stores its current pose, that is the position of bones and the current configuration of slots, attachments, and active skin. The current pose can be computed by either manually modifying the bone transforms, or, more commonly, by applying animations via an `AnimationState`.

The [`AnimationState`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/AnimationState.ts) class is responsible for keeping track of which animation(s) should be applied to a skeleton, advancing and mixing those animations based on the elapsed time between the last and current rendering frame, and applying the animations to a skeleton instance, thereby setting its current pose. The `AnimationState` queries an [`AnimationStateData`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/AnimationStateData.ts) instance to retrieve mixing times between animations, or fetches the default mix time if no mixing time is available for a pair of animations.

The spine-phaser runtime builds on top of these core classes.

## Spine Scene Plugin
The spine-phaser scene plugin adds functionality to (pre-)load exported `.json`, `.skel`, and `.atlas` files to a scene's [LoaderPlugin (`Scene.load`)](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin.html). It provides getters to access the raw skeleton data and texture atlases.

The scene plugin extends the scene's [GameObjectFactory (`Scene.add`)](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory.html) and [GameObjectCreator (`Scene.make`)](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectCreator.html) with functions to create `SpineGameObject` instances from loaded skeleton data and atlas files.

### Loading Spine Assets
Spine assets, like skeleton data `.json`/`.skel` files, or `.atlas` files, are loaded through additional functions added to the [LoaderPlugin (`Scene.load`)](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin.html) of a Phaser [`Scene`](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scene.html) by the [`SpinePlugin`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser/src/SpinePlugin.ts).

* `spineBinary(key: string, url: string, xhrSettings: Phaser.Loader.XHRSettingsObject)`: loads a binary skeleton `.skel` file from the `url` and makes it available via the `key`. The [`XHRSettingsObject`](https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.54.0/Phaser.Types.Loader.XHRSettingsObject) is optional.
* `spineJson(key: string, url: string, xhrSettings: Phaser.Loader.XHRSettingsObject)`: loads a JSON skeleton `.json` file from the `url` and makes it available via the `key`. The [`XHRSettingsObject`](https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.54.0/Phaser.Types.Loader.XHRSettingsObject) is optional.
* `spineAtlas(key: string, url: string, premultipliedAlpha: boolean, xhrSettings: Phaser.Loader.XHRSettingsObject)`: loads texture atlas `.atlas` file and its related `.png` texture atlas page files from the `url` and makes it available via the `key`. The `premultipliedAlpha` parameter is optional and specifies if the atlas was exported with premultiplied-alpha enabled. By default, the value stored in the `.atlas` file is used. The [`XHRSettingsObject`](https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.54.0/Phaser.Types.Loader.XHRSettingsObject) is optional.

Assuming you have exported your skeleton data to a binary skeleton file called `skeleton.skel`, and your atlas to a file called `skeleton.atlas` with one corresponding `skeleton.png` file, you can load your assets in your scene's `preload()` function like this:

```
function preload() {
   this.load.spineBinary("skeleton-data", "path/to/skeleton.skel");
   this.load.spineAtlas("skeleton-atlas", "path/to/skeleton.atlas");
}
```

The `preload()` function loads the [SkeletonData](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/SkeletonData.ts) from the `skeleton.skel` file and caches it under the key `skeleton-data`. It also loads the [TextureAtlas](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/TextureAtlas.ts) from the `skeleton.atlas` file, as well as a texture from the corresponding `skeleton.png` file. The atlas is cached under the key `skeleton-atlas`. The individual texture atlas page images are loaded transparently without the need for explicitly loading them.

Once preloading has finished, you can access the `TextureAtlas` via `Scene.spine.getAtlas(atlasKey)`. Similarly, you can access the raw `SkeletonData` via `Scene.spine.getSkeletonData(dataKey, atlasKey)`. Note the second parameter: a `SkeletonData` instance can only be created in combination with an atlas for that skeleton data.

The skeleton data and atlas on their own can not be animated or rendered. Instead, a [`SpineGameObject`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser/src/SpineGameObject.ts) is constructed from them. `SpineGameObject` instances can share the same skeleton data and atlas.

### Creating SpineGameObject instances
Once skeleton data and a corresponding atlas have been loaded, a `SpineGameObject` can be created and optionally be added to the current scene via the `spine()` functions added to the scene's [GameObjectFactory (`Scene.add`)](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory.html) and [GameObjectCreator (`Scene.make`)](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectCreator.html) by the `SpinePlugin`. You can use them in your scene's `create()` function:

```
function create() {
   // Create a SpineGameObject through the GameObjectFactory and add it to the scene
   const spineObject = this.add.spine(400, 500, "skeleton-data", "skeleton-atlas");

   // Create a SpineGameObject through the GameObjectCreator. It is not automatically
   // added to the scene.
   const spineObject2 = this.make.spine({
      x: 200, y: 500,
      dataKey: "skeleton-data", atlasKey: "skeleton-atlas"
   });

   // Manually add the game object to the scene
   this.add.existing(spineObject2);
}
```

The `spine()` function on the `GameObjectFactory` takes the objects position, the key of the skeleton data, and the key of the atlas as a parameter. This function will automatically add the object to the scene.

The `spine()` function on the `GameObjectCreator` takes a [SpineGameObjectConfig](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/src/SpinePlugin.ts) as a parameter, which also specifies the position, data key, and atlas key. This function will not automatically add the object to the scene.

By default, a `SpineGameObject` is sized based on its setup pose bounding box. This behaviour can be customized by passing an optional [`SpineGameObjectBoundsProvider`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/src/SpineGameObject.ts) parameter to either of the `spine()` functions.

A bounds provider calculates the size of the bounding box of a Spine game object. By default, a `SetupPoseBoundsProvider` is used, which calculates the bounding box based on the bounds of the skeleton in its setup pose.

Another bounds provider is the `SkinsAndAnimationBoundsProvider`, which calculates the bounding box based on the maximum bounding box for a given set of skins and animation.

You can also pass a custom bounds provider to the `spine()` functions by implementing the [`SpineGameObjectBoundsProvider` interface](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/src/SpinePlugin.ts).

## SpineGameObject
A `SpineGameObject` is a Phaser [GameObject](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject.html) that bundles storing, updating, and rendering a `Skeleton` and its associated `AnimationState`. `SpineGameObject` instances are created from a skeleton data and an atlas, as described in the last section. The `Skeleton` and `AnimationState` are accessible through the `skeleton` and `animationState` fields respectively.

Every frame, the `SpineGameObject` will:

* Update the `AnimationState`
* Apply the `AnimationState` to the `Skeleton`
* Update the `Skeleton` world transforms, resulting in a new pose
* Render the `Skeleton` in its current pose

### Applying Animations
Applying animations to a skeleton displayed by a `SpineGameObject` is done through the `AnimationState`.

> **Note:** See [Applying Animations](/spine-applying-animations#AnimationState-API) in the Spine Runtimes Guide for more in-depth information, specifically about animation tracks and animation queueing.

To set a specific animation on track 0, call `AnimationState.setAnimation()`:

```
spineObject.animationState.setAnimation(0, "walk", true);
```

The first parameter specifies the track, the second parameter is the name of the animation, and the third parameter defines whether to loop the animation.

You can queue multiple animations:

```
spineObject.animationState.setAnimation(0, "walk", true);
spineObject.animationState.addAnimation(0, "jump", 2, false);
spineObject.animationState.addAnimation(0, "run", 0, true);
```

The first parameter to `addAnimation()` is the track. The second parameter is the name of the animation. The third parameter specifies the delay in seconds, after which this animation should replace the previous animation on the track. The final parameter defines whether to loop the animation.

In the example above, the `"walk"` animation is played back first. 2 seconds later, the `"jump"` animation is played back once, followed by a transition to the `"run"` animation, which will be looped.

When transitioning from one animation to another, `AnimationState` will mix the animations for a specific duration called mix time. These mix times are defined in an `AnimationStateData` instance, from which the `AnimationState` retrieves mix times.

The `AnimationStateData` instance is also available through the `SpineGameObject`. You can set the default mix time, or the mix time for a specific pair of animations:

```
spineObject.animationStateData.setDefaultMix = 0.2;
spineObject.animationStateData.setMix("walk", "jump", 0.1);
```

When setting or adding an animation, a `TrackEntry` object is returned, which allows further modification of that animation's playback. For example, you can set the track entry to reverse the animation playback:

```
const entry = spineObject.animationState.setAnimation(0, "walk", true);
entry.reverse = true;
```

See the [`TrackEntry` class documentation](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/AnimationState.ts#L785) for more options.

> **Note:** Be careful about holding on to `TrackEntry` instances outside the function you are using them in. Track entries are re-used internally and will thus become invalid once the track entry [dispose event](/spine-api-reference#AnimationStateListener-dispose) occurs.

You can set or queue empty animations on an animation track to smoothly reset the skeleton back to its setup pose:

```
spineObject.animationState.setEmptyAnimation(0, 0.5);
spineObject.animationState.addEmptyAnimation(0, 0.5, 0.5);
```

The first parameter to `setEmptyAnimation()` specifies the track. The second parameter specifies the mix duration in seconds used to mix out the previous animation and mix in the "empty" animation.

The first parameter to `addEmptyAnimation()` specifies the track. The second parameter specifies the mix duration. The third parameter is the delay in seconds, after which the empty animation should replace the previous animation on the track via mixing.

All animations on a track can be cleared immediately via `AnimationState.clearTrack()`. To clear all tracks at once, `AnimationState.clearTracks()` can be used. This will leave the skeleton in the last pose it was in.

To reset the pose of a skeleton to the setup pose, use `Skeleton.setToSetupPose()`:

```
spineObject.skeleton.setToSetupPose();
```

This will reset both the bones and slots to their setup pose configuration. Use `Skeleton.setSlotsToSetupPose()` to only reset the slots to their setup pose configuration.

### AnimationState Events
An `AnimationState` emits events during the life-cycle of an animation that is being played back. You can listen for this events to react as needed. The Spine Runtimes API defines the following [event types](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/AnimationState.ts#L1108):

* `start`: emitted when an animation is started.
* `interrupt`: emitted when an animation's track was cleared, or a new animation was set.
* `end`: emitted when an animation will never be applied again.
* `dispose`: emitted when the animation's track entry is disposed.
* `complete`: emitted when an animation completes a loop.
* `event`: emitted when a user defined [event](/spine-events#Events) happened.

To receive events, you can register an [`AnimationStateListener`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-core/src/AnimationState.ts#L1117) callback with either the `AnimationState` to receive events across all animations, or with the `TrackEntry` of a specific animation queued for playback:

```
spineObject.animationState.addListener({
    start: (entry) => log(`Started animation ${entry.animation.name}`),
    interrupt: (entry) => log(`Interrupted animation ${entry.animation.name}`),
    end: (entry) => log(`Ended animation ${entry.animation.name}`),
    dispose: (entry) => log(`Disposed animation ${entry.animation.name}`),
    complete: (entry) => log(`Completed animation ${entry.animation.name}`),
    event: (entry, event) => log(`Custom event for ${entry.animation.name}: ${event.data.name}`)
})

trackEntry.listener = {
    event: (entry, event) => log(`Custom event for ${entry.animation.name}: ${event.data.name}`)
}
```

See the [`events-example.html`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example/events-example.html) example.

## Skins
Many applications and games allow users to create custom avatars out of many individual items, such as hair, eyes, pants, or accessories like earrings or bags. With Spine, this can be achived by [mixing and matching skins](/spine-examples-mix-and-match).

You can create custom skins from other skins like this:

```
const skeletonData = spineObject.skeleton.data;
const skin = new spine.Skin("custom");
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("skin-base"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("nose/short"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("eyelids/girly"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("eyes/violet"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("hair/brown"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("clothes/hoodie-orange"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("legs/pants-jeans"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("accessories/bag"));
skin.addSkin(skeletonData.findSkin("accessories/hat-red-yellow"));
spineObject.skeleton.setSkin(skin);
spineObject.skeleton.setToSetupPose();
```

Create a custom skin with the `Skin()` constructor.

Next, fetch the `SkeletonData` from the skeleton. It is used to look up skins by name via `SkeletonData.findSkin()`.

Add all the skins you want to combine into the new custom skin via `Skin.addSkin()`.

Finally, set the new skin on the `Skeleton` and call `Skeleton.setSlotsToSetupPose()` to ensure no attachments from previous skins and/or animations are left over.

See [`mix-and-match-example.html`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example/mix-and-match-example.html) for full example code.

## Setting Bone Transforms
When authoring a skeleton in the Spine Editor, the skeleton is defined in what is called the skeleton's world coordinate system or "skeleton coordinate system". This coordinate system may not align with the coordinate system of Phaser. Mouse and touch coordinates relative to the `SpineGameObject` need thus be converted to the skeleton coordinate system, e.g. if a user should be able to move a bone by touch.

The `SpineGameObject` offers the method `phaserWorldCoordinatesToBone(point: { x: number, y: number}, bone: Bone)` which takes an a point relative to the SpineGameObject and converts it to the skeleton's coordinate system, relative to the specified bone.

The reverse, that is converting from the skeleton coordinate system to the Phaser coordinate system, can be achieved via `SpineGameObject.skeletonToPhaserWorldCoordinates(point: { x: number, y: number})`.

See [`control-bones-example.html`](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example/control-bones-example.html) for full example code.

## Spine Runtimes API access
spine-phaser exposes the entire [spine-ts core](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/4.2/spine-ts/spine-core) API via the `SpineGameObject` properties `skeleton`, `animationStateData`, and `animationState`. See the JS doc documentation of these classes as well as the generic [Spine Runtimes Guide](/spine-runtimes-guide).

## Differences to the Phaser Spine Plugin
Phaser offers its own [Spine Plugin](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/SpineGameObject.html) which is based on our `spine-ts WebGL` runtime. While writing our official spine-phaser runtime, we tried to stay as close to the API provided by Phaser. Here we discuss the few differences between the Phaser provided plugin and our official spine-phaser runtime API.

Starting with Spine 4.1, our spine-phaser runtime will be maintained like our other Spine Runtimes. This means you'll get timely updates whenever a new Spine Editor version is released, you will have access to beta runtimes for the next Spine Editor version, and you'll receive all the latest improvements and bug fixes in a timely manner. The Phaser maintainers may not be able to provide such guarantees, as the Spine Plugin is understandably not their number one priority.

On the API side, there are a handful of differences to watch out for.

### Loading skeleton and atlas data
Loading a skeleton and its atlas with the Phaser Spine Plugin is a single step:

```javascript
this.load.spine('spineboy', 'spineboy.json`, [ `spineboy.atlas` ], true);
```

With the spine-phaser runtime, the atlas data and skeleton data are loaded separately.

```
this.load.spineBinary("spineboy-data", "spineboy.skel");
this.load.spineAtlas("spineboy-atlas", "spineboy.atlas");
```

This allows you to share the same atlas across different skeletons. The spine-phaser runtime also supports both loading JSON and binary skeleton data, whereas the Phaser Spine Plugin can only load JSON skeleton data. Finally, the loader methods will automatically deduce if a skeleton's atlas uses pre-multiplied alpha or not.

The spine-phaser skeleton data loader does not support loading multiple spine skeletons from a single JSON file while the Phaser Spine Plugin does.

### Creating SpineGameObject instances
Creating a `SpineGameObject` with the Phaser Spine Plugin references only a single loaded asset, and offers many additional, optional parameters.

```javascript
const spineboy = this.add.spine(400, 600, 'spineboy', 'idle', true);
```

The spine-phaser runtime requires you to specify the keys of both the skeleton data and atlas.

```javascript
const spineboy = this.add.spine(400, 500, 'spineboy-data', "spineboy-atlas");
spineboy.animationState.setAnimation(0, "idle", true)
```

You can provide an optional `SkeletonBoundsProvider` as the 5th parameter as described above. However, you can not configure any other properties through this method. Instead, you directly access the methods and properties of the `SpineGameObject` to configure it to your liking.

### Spine Container
The Phaser Spine Plugin features a special container class called [SpineContainer](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/SpineContainer.html). Its purpose is to batch the rendering of multiple `SpineGameObject` instances contained within it for better performance.

With the spine-phaser runtime, this is not necessary, as the renderer will automatically batch subsequent `SpineGameObject` instances if possible, irrespective of their container parent.

### Examples ports
To further ease the transition from the Phaser Spine Plugin to our official spine-phaser runtime, we've ported most of the [Phaser Spine Plugin examples](https://labs.phaser.io/index.html?dir=spine4/&q=) to the [spine-phaser runtime](/git/spine-runtimes/spine-ts/spine-phaser-v4/example/).
